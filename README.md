# Hurry Chess
Normal rapid chess but a move needs to be played within a fixed time limit otherwise
game will play a bad move for you instead.

# Capabilities
1. Can play normal chess (may have some weird artifacts as all conditions are not checked)
2. Shows check, chekmate, stalemate, etc and has valid rule checking
3. Has few key inputs to do special things like undo, reset, switch turn (without actually playing)

# Note
1. Time aspect of the chess is not yet implemented

# TODO
1. Polishing Gui
2. Implementing a move recommendation system
3. Implementing game's core logic 
4. Optmizing the game's checks and improve performance
